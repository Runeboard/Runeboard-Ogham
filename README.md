# Runeboard with Ogham

This is the complete Runeboard, including various rune-related Latin characters and Ogham. You are welcome to share these files but you may need Keyman in order to use them.

All files have been made available here so you can copy and modify them to suit your own preferences if desired.

Please note that the Roman Numerals encoded on the number row of the Alt+Ctrl+Shift (i.e. Ogham) layer are the actual Unicode code points intended for representing Roman Numerals (i.e. U+216x & U+218x). Some fonts may not displayed these characters correctly.
